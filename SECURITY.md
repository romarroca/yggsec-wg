## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
- **Regular Updates**: Keep YggSec WireG updated to latest version
- **Network Security**: Properly configure firewall rules
- **Access Control**: Limit administrative access
- **Monitoring**: Review logs regularly for suspicious activity

### For Administrators

- **Secure Installation**: Follow installation guide security notes
- **Certificate Management**: Use proper SSL/TLS certificates
- **Backup Security**: Secure configuration backups
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate management interfaces
- **Audit Trails**: Enable comprehensive logging

### For Developers

- **Code Review**: All changes require security review
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Privilege Separation**: Follow least privilege principle
- **Secure Defaults**: Configure secure defaults
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated

## Security Features

YggSec WireG includes several security features:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication with timeout
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Secure password hashing (Werkzeug)
- Systemd process sandboxing

### Network Security
- HTTPS-only web interface
- WireGuard VPN encryption
- nftables firewall integration
- Suricata IPS for threat detection

### System Security
- Systemd service hardening
- Capability-based privilege model
- NoNewPrivileges protection
- Secure file permissions

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection

## Security Hardening Guide

### Recommended Settings

```bash
# Admin password will be prompted securely during setup
# (minimum 8 characters required, longer passwords recommended)

# Enable all security features
sudo systemctl enable suricata
sudo systemctl start suricata

# Regular security updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo suricata-update
```

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Changed default admin password
- [ ] Enabled HTTPS with valid certificates
- [ ] Configured proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enabled IPS (Suricata) monitoring
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and rotation
- [ ] Restricted network access to management interface
- [ ] Regularly update system and application
- [ ] Monitor for security advisories

## Known Security Considerations

### Network Exposure
- Web interface requires careful network exposure planning
- Management interface should be restricted to trusted networks
- Consider VPN-only access for remote management

### Privilege Requirements
- Service requires network administration capabilities
- Runs with minimal required privileges via systemd
- File permissions restrict access to sensitive configurations

### Dependencies
- Relies on system-level packages (WireGuard, nftables, Suricata)
- Regular dependency updates recommended
- Monitor for CVEs in core dependencies

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible for critical vulnerabilities
- Announced through GitHub Security Advisories
- Documented with clear upgrade instructions
- Coordinated with vulnerability reporters
